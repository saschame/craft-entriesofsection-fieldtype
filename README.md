# Entries of Section plugin for Craft CMS

Craft field type plugin that extends the core Entries field type to limit listed entries by the current entries section

## Installation

To install Entries of Section, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `entriesofsection` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
3. The plugin folder should be named `entriesofsection` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

Entries of Section works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.

## Entries of Section Overview

This field type is an extension of the built in `Entries` field type and has been shamelessly ripped-off of [n43.me](http://n43.me/)'s [Entries Subset plugin](https://github.com/nfourtythree/craft-entriessubset).

It restricts selectable entries of the `Entry`-fieldtype to entries of the currently active entries section.
